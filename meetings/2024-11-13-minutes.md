# Privacy TF Call - Wed 13 November 2024

Present: Dan, Tara, Jeffrey, Don, Yves, Wendy

Regrets: Pete, Nick

https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/431 collects all the PRs we need to review.

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/432

*we review and agree to merge*

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/444

*we leave it unmerged*

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/441

Jeffrey: the objection is broad - but in the conversation it seemed like they wanted us to point out that people should consult local regulations... instead of assuming that we described everything.  

*we agree to wendy's [suggestion](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/441/files#r1813083399)* 

*and agree to merge*

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/442

Don: giving users ability to tag info as sensitive is not especially useful (because it is possible to infer sensitive information from data that appears non-sensitive)

*noting Martin's [comment](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/442/files#r1779902987) that this implies privacy labor*

*consensus not to do this for various reasons including above*

### https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/449

Jeffrey: we've had discussions in the GPC context of whether a global opt-out overrides specific agreements. Consensus may be emerging in privacy CG that if you have a specific agreement that this should override the global signal. (https://github.com/privacycg/gpc-spec/issues/80) Should we therefore make a change in the privacy principles? My sense is to leave it for this version.

Dan: agree with not doing anything... Also I don't think this will make our lives easier in council.

Tara: I would leave it in the understanding that this is going to be revisited... (once GPC is further developed.)

### Agreement to "send this to council"

Yves: the issue with the documentation included is good... 

*Yves to pursue the objector.*

*Yves to shuttle the current editors' draft out to /TR space.*

*Jeffrey to fix something in the summary by end of today.*
